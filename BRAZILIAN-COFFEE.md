Brazilian specialty coffee with distinctive caramel notes and naturally sweet flavor profile.

**Characteristics:**
- Sweet caramel and toffee notes
- Smooth, full-bodied texture
- Low acidity
- Natural sweetness without additives

### 2. Café Garapa (Sugarcane Coffee)
**Price:** R$ 15.90

**Description:**
Unique Brazilian coffee with natural sugarcane sweetness, representing Brazil's coffee and sugarcane heritage.

**Characteristics:**
- Sweet notes reminiscent of sugarcane juice (garapa)
- Light to medium body
- Pleasant acidity
- Distinctive Brazilian terroir
- Naturally sweet without being overwhelming

**Origin:**
"Garapa" is the Brazilian Portuguese word for fresh sugarcane juice. This coffee variety earned its name from its natural sweetness and flavor profile that evokes the taste of fresh sugarcane. It celebrates Brazil's dual heritage as the world's largest producer of both coffee and sugarcane.

**Cultural Note:**
In Brazil, "garapa" is a popular street beverage - fresh sugarcane juice extracted on the spot. The coffee's name pays homage to this beloved Brazilian drink.

### 3. Jacu Bird Coffee (Café do Jacu)
**Price:** R$ 89.90

**Description:**
Rare and exotic Brazilian coffee from beans that have been eaten and naturally processed by the Jacu bird. One of the world's most unique and expensive coffees.

**Characteristics:**
- Extremely rare and unique
- Complex flavor profile
- Smooth, refined taste
- Low acidity
- Notes of dried fruits and spices
- Exceptional smoothness
- No bitterness

**Origin:**
This extraordinary coffee is produced through a natural process involving the Jacu bird (*Penelope jacucaca*), a species native to Brazil's Atlantic Forest. The birds selectively eat only the ripest, highest-quality coffee cherries. As the cherries pass through the bird's digestive system, natural enzymes and fermentation occur, creating a unique flavor profile.

**Production Process:**
1. Jacu birds forage in coffee plantations
2. They selectively eat only the ripest cherries
3. Natural fermentation occurs during digestion
4. Beans are collected from bird droppings
5. Thoroughly cleaned and processed
6. Carefully roasted

**Why It's Expensive:**
- **Rarity**: Limited production
- **Natural Selection**: Birds choose only premium beans
- **Unique Process**: Can't be replicated artificially
- **Labor Intensive**: Requires careful collection and processing
- **Exclusive**: Similar to Kopi Luwak but with distinct characteristics

**Sustainability:**
Unlike some animal-processed coffees, Jacu bird coffee is typically produced in a more natural, free-range manner, with birds freely choosing the coffee cherries in their natural habitat.

**Similar Coffees:**
- Kopi Luwak (Indonesia) - processed by Asian palm civet
- Black Ivory Coffee (Thailand) - processed by elephants
- Jacu Bird Coffee stands out as a uniquely Brazilian contribution to exotic coffees
